User Stories — Detailed Report
1. Definition of User Stories

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the end user.
It focuses on what the user needs, why they need it, and the value it provides.

User stories are used in Agile and Scrum to:

Capture customer requirements

Encourage collaboration between business and technical teams

Break large features into manageable pieces

Keep development focused on user value

Format of a User Story

A standard user story follows this format:

As a type of user
I want a goal or feature
So that I receive a benefit or value

This ensures the requirement is:

User-centered

Value-driven

Clear and concise

Examples

As a customer, I want to view my account balance so that I can track my spending.

As an admin, I want to generate monthly reports so that I can analyze user activity.

As a student, I want to download my grade sheet so that I can keep a personal record.

2. How to Write Effective User Stories

To write high-quality user stories, teams often follow the INVEST model:

I — Independent

A story should stand alone, without depending heavily on another story.

N — Negotiable

It is not a contract; details can be refined through discussion.

V — Valuable

It must deliver clear value to the user or business.

E — Estimable

The team should be able to estimate its size/effort.

S — Small

It should fit into a single sprint (1–2 weeks).

T — Testable

There must be a clear way to verify it is complete.

General Rules for Writing Effective User Stories

Focus on the user, not the system

Wrong: “The system should send a notification.”

Correct: “As a user, I want to receive notifications so that I stay informed.”

Keep it short and simple
A user story should capture the essence of the requirement in one sentence.

Avoid technical language
Use business language, not implementation details.

Include the reason/value ("So that…")
This helps developers understand why the feature matters.

Make sure the story is testable
If you cannot test it, it’s not clear enough.

Split large stories (Epics) into smaller pieces
Example:

“As a customer, I want to manage my account.” → too big
Break into:

View balance

Update profile

Change password

View transactions

3. Acceptance Criteria and Their Importance
What Are Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance criteria are conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete.
They define the boundaries of the story and clarify expectations.

They are usually written in:

Bullet points, or

Given / When / Then (BDD style)

Why Acceptance Criteria Are Important

Acceptance criteria:

Ensure Clarity
They remove ambiguity and prevent misunderstandings.

Guide Development
Developers know exactly what to build and what success looks like.

Guide Testing
QA testers use acceptance criteria to validate the story.

Define "Done"
They act as a checklist to confirm the story meets requirements.

Help Estimate Better
Clear requirements = more accurate story point estimation.

Reduce Rework
When expectations are clear, less chances of rebuilding or modifying features later.

Example of a User Story with Acceptance Criteria
User Story

As a customer, I want to receive a password reset email so that I can recover access to my account.

Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

Given the user is on the login page
When they click “Forgot Password”
Then they should be asked to enter their registered email.

Given a valid email is entered
When the user submits the form
Then a reset link email should be sent.

Given the email is not registered
When the user submits the form
Then an error message “Email not found” should appear.

The reset link must expire after 15 minutes.

The user must be able to set a new password through the link.

Example of Bullet-Point Acceptance Criteria

User Story: As a user, I want to update my mobile number so that my contact information stays correct.

Acceptance Criteria:

User can enter a new phone number.

System must validate the number format.

User must receive a verification code.

Number is updated only after confirming the verification code.

Updated number appears in the profile page.

  User Story                  A short statement describing user need and
                              value

  Format                      “As a… I want… So that…”

  Effective Stories           Follow the INVEST model: Independent,
                              Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small,
                              Testable

  Acceptance Criteria         Conditions that determine when a story is
                              complete; guide development and testing

  Importance                  Provides clarity, reduces rework, ensures
                              high quality, defines “Done”
